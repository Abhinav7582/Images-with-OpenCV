Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image and or to extract some useful information from it. 
If we talk about the basic definition of image processing then “Image processing is the analysis and manipulation of a digitized image, especially in order to improve its quality”. 
Digital-Image : 
An image may be defined as a two-dimensional function f(x, y), where x and y are spatial(plane) coordinates, and the amplitude of fat any pair of coordinates (x, y) is called the intensity or grey level of the image at that point. 
In another word An image is nothing more than a two-dimensional matrix (3-D in case of coloured images) which is defined by the mathematical function f(x, y) at any point is giving the pixel value at that point of an image, the pixel value describes how bright that pixel is, and what colour it should be. 
Image processing is basically signal processing in which input is an image and output is image or characteristics according to requirement associated with that image.
